# Dijkstras-Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm, capable of discovering the shortest path across a network (graph) developed in Python

1. Read in a file called “network.txt” – a multi-line file with node, nearest neighbour and distance metric information
2. Read in a file called “route.txt”  – a single line file with start and destination information, where the line is of the form “B>F” (any start / end combination is possible)
3. Print out to the screen the shortest path and total distance


* Max Flow

1. Read in a file called “network.txt” – a multi-line file with node, nearest neighbour and distance metric information
2. Read in a file called “route.txt”  – a single line file with start and destination information, where the line is of the form “B>F” (any start / end combination is possible)
3. Print out to the screen every path discovered during the calculation, along with its associated bottleneck flow value
4. Then print out the total max flow for the network
